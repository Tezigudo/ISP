## End-to-End Test of WePay

Describe what functionality is demonstrated by your E2E code.

## How To Run

Steps to run the E2E test.  Try to keep it simple.
The project server should already be running, either locally or in the cloud.

## Files

- `cloud.env` - values of environment variables needed to run tests when the project server is running on a cloud server
- `local.env` - values of environment variables needed to run tests when the project server is running locally


If using Robot Framework, these files should be named `cloud.txt` and `local.txt`.
