## Unit Testing Problem

Write unit tests for the BankAccount class in the file `bank_account.py`.    
Put your tests in a file named `bank_account_test.py`.

1. Write tests for the *specification* not the actual BankAccount code.
2. Write tests to verify *any* BankAccount code that has the same methods -- not just the sample code.
3. Write enough tests for the specification but please don't write redundant tests.
4. Tests should not access attributes of BankAccount or depend on details of the implementation.
5. Do not write tests for:
   - the constructor
   - `min_balance` property
   - `__str__` method
6. It is OK to use more than one `assert` per test method.

## What to Submit

Create a file named `bank_account_test.py` containing your unit tests.

Add it to the repository and push to Github.

When you push to Github, it will run your tests against several implementations of BankAccount containing various bugs.  

See how many defects you can detect.
