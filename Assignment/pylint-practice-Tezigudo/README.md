## Code Checking with Pylint

Use [pylint][pylint] to find & fix coding problems in `person.py`.  
```
pylint person.py
```
Fix the problems and rerun pylint until you get a score of 10.

Push the corrected code to Github.

### Install Pylint

pylint may already be installed on your computer. 
Type `pylint --version` to check.

If not, install it using:
```
pip install pylint
``` 
On some systems, "pip" is named "pip3".
