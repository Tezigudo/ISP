## Logging Practice

1. Create your own repo for this practice. (Done automatically if using Github Classroom).

2. Modify `logging_demo.py` as per the exercises described here <https://cpske.github.io/ISP/logging/logging-practice>.

3. Push your final code to Github.

4. Modify `factor.py` so that it uses logging instead of `print` statements.
   - Log messages to a file, so the output does not interfere with user dialog
   - Log exceptions caught in `__main__` with a stacktrace, but don't show the stacktrace on the console.

5. Test your factor code.  When done, push to Github.
